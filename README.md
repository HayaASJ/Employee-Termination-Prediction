# Project Proposal
This report is one of the T5 bootcamp requirements.

# Abstract
The most critical component of accomplishment in the system is an effective employee who has numerous characteristics. These characteristics are his ability to validate himself through good points of sale, commitment, and adherence to the official's satisfaction. Moreover, this will assist the organization's functioning process and delivery mechanism that will reflect the product's quality. The improvement of a company image, which is an essential element, is demonstrated by the satisfaction of personnel's service. Furthermore, staff turnover will reduce the functionality of an organization if there is a lack of employees. This study aims to predict if the employee will resign or not.

# Dataset
This dataset used in this research is publicly available. The dataset consists of employeeâ€™s information like (employee id - employee record date (year of data) - birth date hire - age - length of service - city - department ). The data contains 49653 instances with 18 variables. 
The dataset can be found at Kaggle. 
Logistic Regression and Random Forest will be used to fit a model and compare for these two classification methods, which one is the better.

# Tools
There are many tools that be used to acheive the goal of the study, such as: numpy, pandas.
For discovering the data and train a model. The work will be done through Jupyter notebook.

# To Do:
Explore and clean the data with EDA phases then use a model to fit the data.
# NOTE: the used features may be increased or changed in the model as well.
